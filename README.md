Semantic Search + Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Streamlit UI

An end-to-end Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that performs semantic search over structured documents and generates grounded, contextual answers using a Large Language Model (Gemini).


🚀 Overview

This project implements a production-style RAG architecture that allows users to query large document collections using semantic similarity instead of keyword matching.

The system:

Encodes documents into embeddings

Performs cosine similarity search

Applies semantic filtering and validation

Builds structured context windows

Generates answers strictly grounded in retrieved content

Exposes the full pipeline through an interactive Streamlit web interface

The project is designed to be:

Modular

Easily extensible

Suitable for real-world enterprise use cases

Ready for portfolio and technical evaluation
